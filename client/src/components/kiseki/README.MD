# Kiseki Internal UI Component Library

* This folder will be foundation of our future `UI Component Library`
* For the sake of the MVP, we will build a simple component on top of `shadcn/ui`, this link could be useful for the future [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChjoKSNWiBo&ab_channel=Rajtalkstech)
* The way I'm writing the component right now is another wrapper on top of the shadcn, there could be a better method to it.
